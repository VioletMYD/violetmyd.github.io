                    Jujutsu Kaisen 0 (Japanese: 劇場版 呪術廻戦 0, Hepburn: 
                    Gekijōban Jujutsu Kaisen Zero, "Jujutsu Kaisen 0: The 
                    Movie") is a 2021 Japanese animated dark fantasy film.[4] I
                    t is based on the 2017 manga Jujutsu Kaisen 0, which is 
                    itself a prequel to the manga series Jujutsu Kaisen, both 
                    mangas having been written by Gege Akutami. It was directed 
                    by Sunghoo Park from a screenplay by Hiroshi Seko, and stars 
                    Megumi Ogata, Kana Hanazawa, Mikako Komatsu, Kōki Uchiyama, 
                    Tomokazu Seki, Yuichi Nakamura, and Takahiro Sakurai. The 
                    film follows Yuta Okkotsu, a young student who becomes a 
                    sorcerer and seeks to control the Cursed Spirit of his 
                    childhood friend Rika Orimoto in Jujutsu High, alongside 
                    other skilled sorcerers in training.

                    Originally intended as an arc of the animated television 
                    series Jujutsu Kaisen, studio MAPPA changed the format of it 
                    during discussion. The staff decided to expand the narrative 
                    from that of the original manga by adding new scenes focused 
                    on Yuta's mentor Satoru Gojo and the antagonist Suguru Geto. 
                    King Gnu performed the two theme songs. Given the large 
                    budget for the movie, MAPPA aimed to make more appealing 
                    fight sequences than the ones from the animated television 
                    series.

                    Jujutsu Kaisen 0 was released in Japan on December 24, 2021, 
                    by Toho. Upon its release, the film received positive 
                    reviews for its accessible storytelling, the animated fight 
                    sequences, and soundtrack. However, it was also criticized 
                    for its short length, as some characters felt underdeveloped 
                    when compared to the lead. It was the highest-grossing film 
                    at the Japanese box office in 2021, and took $196.2 million 
                    worldwide.

                <p>
                    High school student Yuta Okkotsu suffers from being 
                    frequently bullied, when one day, his bullies are gravely 
                    injured by a Cursed Spirit that clings to him. The higher-
                    ups of the Jujutsu Society wish to have the boy killed, as 
                    his curse is a dangerous spirit. However, a teacher at Tokyo 
                    Jujutsu Technical High, Satoru Gojo, recruits Yuta to join 
                    the school in November 2016, thus saving him. Yuta explains 
                    that the Cursed Spirit is Rika, a childhood friend whom he 
                    had promised to marry when they grew up. Rika died in a 
                    freak accident and became an overprotective spirit that 
                    harms anyone who threatens him. Yuta meets fellow students 
                    Maki Zen'in, Toge Inumaki, and Panda, all with distinct 
                    abilities of their own.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During his first mission with Maki, Yuta successfully 
                    summons Rika on his own for the first time to save them from 
                    a Cursed Spirit. Three months pass in his school training, 
                    and he grows close to Maki, Toge, and Panda. One day, on a 
                    mission with Toge, the boys are attacked by a high-level 
                    Curse. The man behind the attack was Suguru Geto, a previous 
                    student and old friend of Gojo's, who defected from the 
                    school and killed over a hundred innocent people on a 
                    mission.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Geto attempts to get Yuta on his side so they can make use 
                    of Rika, but Yuta refuses when he insults Yuta's friends due 
                    to unsettled circumstances. Geto declares war to activate a 
                    portal to the under-world: he will release a thousand Curses 
                    upon the city to remove non-sorcerer humans, as he believes 
                    them to be undeserving and beneath sorcerers. Geto's real 
                    reason for the war, however, is to distract Gojo so he can 
                    kill Yuta and add Rika to his collection of cursed spirits. 
                    Gojo realizes this upon learning of Yuta's background, and 
                    sends Inumaki and Panda back to the school to protect Yuta 
                    and Maki during the night of Geto's attack. Geto overpowers 
                    them all, leaving only Yuta conscious. Enraged at seeing his 
                    friends hurt, Yuta promises himself as a sacrifice to Rika 
                    in order to strengthen their bond. As a result, Geto is 
                    severely wounded. He is found by Gojo, who after reflecting 
                    on their past friendship, executes him.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Gojo confirms that Yuta was the one who inadvertently cursed 
                    Rika through un-specified ties to royal bloodlines within 
                    the hierarchy of Japan's caste system, rather than the other 
                    way around, by being unable to accept her death. Yuta broke 
                    the curse after promising himself to Rika, and she is able 
                    to pass on peacefully after Yuta continues training as a 
                    sorcerer within the institution.

                <p>
                    In a post-credits scene, Geto's former ally Miguel eats 
                    lunch with Yuta in Kenya, and Gojo comes to join them.
