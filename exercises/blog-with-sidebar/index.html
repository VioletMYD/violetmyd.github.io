                    Jujutsu Kaisen 0 (Japanese: 劇場版 呪術廻戦 0, Hepburn: 
                    Gekijōban Jujutsu Kaisen Zero, "Jujutsu Kaisen 0: The 
                    Movie") is a 2021 Japanese animated dark fantasy film.[4] I
                    t is based on the 2017 manga Jujutsu Kaisen 0, which is 
                    itself a prequel to the manga series Jujutsu Kaisen, both 
                    mangas having been written by Gege Akutami. It was directed 
                    by Sunghoo Park from a screenplay by Hiroshi Seko, and stars 
                    Megumi Ogata, Kana Hanazawa, Mikako Komatsu, Kōki Uchiyama, 
                    Tomokazu Seki, Yuichi Nakamura, and Takahiro Sakurai. The 
                    film follows Yuta Okkotsu, a young student who becomes a 
                    sorcerer and seeks to control the Cursed Spirit of his 
                    childhood friend Rika Orimoto in Jujutsu High, alongside 
                    other skilled sorcerers in training.

                    Originally intended as an arc of the animated television 
                    series Jujutsu Kaisen, studio MAPPA changed the format of it 
                    during discussion. The staff decided to expand the narrative 
                    from that of the original manga by adding new scenes focused 
                    on Yuta's mentor Satoru Gojo and the antagonist Suguru Geto. 
                    King Gnu performed the two theme songs. Given the large 
                    budget for the movie, MAPPA aimed to make more appealing 
                    fight sequences than the ones from the animated television 
                    series.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Jujutsu Kaisen 0 was released in Japan on December 24, 2021, 
                    by Toho. Upon its release, the film received positive 
                    reviews for its accessible storytelling, the animated fight 
                    sequences, and soundtrack. However, it was also criticized 
                    for its short length, as some characters felt underdeveloped 
                    when compared to the lead. It was the highest-grossing film 
                    at the Japanese box office in 2021, and took $196.2 million 
                    worldwide.

                <h3 id="sub">Plot</h3>
                <p>
                    High school student Yuta Okkotsu suffers from being 
                    frequently bullied, when one day, his bullies are gravely 
                    injured by a Cursed Spirit that clings to him. The higher-
                    ups of the Jujutsu Society wish to have the boy killed, as 
                    his curse is a dangerous spirit. However, a teacher at Tokyo 
                    Jujutsu Technical High, Satoru Gojo, recruits Yuta to join 
                    the school in November 2016, thus saving him. Yuta explains 
                    that the Cursed Spirit is Rika, a childhood friend whom he 
                    had promised to marry when they grew up. Rika died in a 
                    freak accident and became an overprotective spirit that 
                    harms anyone who threatens him. Yuta meets fellow students 
                    Maki Zen'in, Toge Inumaki, and Panda, all with distinct 
                    abilities of their own.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During his first mission with Maki, Yuta successfully 
                    summons Rika on his own for the first time to save them from 
                    a Cursed Spirit. Three months pass in his school training, 
                    and he grows close to Maki, Toge, and Panda. One day, on a 
                    mission with Toge, the boys are attacked by a high-level 
                    Curse. The man behind the attack was Suguru Geto, a previous 
                    student and old friend of Gojo's, who defected from the 
                    school and killed over a hundred innocent people on a 
                    mission.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Geto attempts to get Yuta on his side so they can make use 
                    of Rika, but Yuta refuses when he insults Yuta's friends due 
                    to unsettled circumstances. Geto declares war to activate a 
                    portal to the under-world: he will release a thousand Curses 
                    upon the city to remove non-sorcerer humans, as he believes 
                    them to be undeserving and beneath sorcerers. Geto's real 
                    reason for the war, however, is to distract Gojo so he can 
                    kill Yuta and add Rika to his collection of cursed spirits. 
                    Gojo realizes this upon learning of Yuta's background, and 
                    sends Inumaki and Panda back to the school to protect Yuta 
                    and Maki during the night of Geto's attack. Geto overpowers 
                    them all, leaving only Yuta conscious. Enraged at seeing his 
                    friends hurt, Yuta promises himself as a sacrifice to Rika 
                    in order to strengthen their bond. As a result, Geto is 
                    severely wounded. He is found by Gojo, who after reflecting 
                    on their past friendship, executes him.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Gojo confirms that Yuta was the one who inadvertently cursed 
                    Rika through un-specified ties to royal bloodlines within 
                    the hierarchy of Japan's caste system, rather than the other 
                    way around, by being unable to accept her death. Yuta broke 
                    the curse after promising himself to Rika, and she is able 
                    to pass on peacefully after Yuta continues training as a 
                    sorcerer within the institution.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In a post-credits scene, Geto's former ally Miguel eats 
                    lunch with Yuta in Kenya, and Gojo comes to join them.

                    Jujutsu Kaisen 0 is a prequel to the Jujutsu Kaisen 
                    television anime by studio MAPPA and based on the manga of 
                    the same name by manga artist Gege Akutami. Sunghoo Park 
                    originally wanted to protagonist Yuta Okkotsu from the first 
                    few episodes of the TV series. However, the idea was 
                    scrapped and the anime began, with Yuji Itadori's 
                    introduction to the world of sorcerers and curses similar 
                    based on the Jujutsu Kaisen manga.[18] In the original 
                    format, Park would adapt the series' first three episodes to 
                    develop Yuji and then replace him with Okkotsu, but that 
                    idea was discarded.[19] Park later felt that telling the 
                    Jujutsu Kaisen prequel would fit the movie format more than 
                    a television series. Seko commented that, for the movie to 
                    fill two hours, he would need to add new material, such as 
                    Okkotsu's past and the relationship between Gojo and Geto. 
                    Seko said that the action scenes of Akutami's manga are the 
                    most important part of that series, he wanted to focus on 
                    them in the movie. Park agreed and added elements of Chinese 
                    movies to the film, which he wanted fans to look forward to.

                <p>
                    With the eventual remake as a film, MAPPA produced the film 
                    with director Sunghoo Park, and writer Hiroshi Seko 
                    returning from the TV series to work on it. Character 
                    designs were handled by Tadashi Hiramatsu.[20][21] The film 
                    was announced after the Jujutsu Kaisen anime television 
                    series finale in March 2021.[22] While the television series 
                    was noted for having entertaining fight scenes, the team 
                    wanted to improve them.[19] While not too different from the 
                    television series, Park aimed to make the film have its own 
                    style, such as the background colors when the sky is shown. 
                    Park noted there were multiple challenges in making the 
                    animated movie, when compared with his experience with live-
                    actions, due to the amount of animation needed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Park said that the movie would include new content not 
                    featured in the original Jujutsu Kaisen 0 manga.[24] This 
                    was mainly because the movie was based on a single manga 
                    volume, and the team aimed to make a long film rather than a 
                    thirty-minute work. MAPPA CEO Manabu Otsuka said that the 
                    team was impressed by the original Jujutsu Kaisen 0 and 
                    believed the fans would like to see it adapted. Seko said he 
                    had to alter the parts from the original series to make 
                    Yuta's character arc more notable. The post-credits scene of 
                    the movie is an original scene not present in the manga. 
                    Toho had doubts about creating such content until they 
                    contacted Akutami who gave them the idea.

                >

                <p>
                    In casting Megumi Ogata, Gege Akutami envisioned the 
                    character as "neutral, soft, and kind, and there is also a 
                    big emotional swing and head." Ogata's name was mentioned as 
                    an example of an actor close to that, and in response to 
                    that, the director Sunghoo Park and the anime staff 
                    unanimously decided to cast her. Ogata herself said she 
                    would like to cherish the original image as well as create 
                    her own image of Yuta.[30] Ogata describes him as an 
                    attractive character due to how strong he becomes when 
                    interacting with others.[31] Sunghoo Park was also behind 
                    the casting of Yuta's voice actor, although Yuta was now a 
                    young male voiced by a woman.[32] Ogata surprised Park in 
                    the making of the movie by giving Yuta a sensitive 
                    characterization in crying.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Kana Hanazawa was cast to voice Rika. She wanted to 
                    audition, as she was a fan of the original anime and 
                    television series. The story of Rika's childhood left a 
                    major impression on Hanazawa, who looked forward to 
                    interacting with Ogata.[33] Hanazawa enthusiastically 
                    expressed Rika's love for Yuta, and Ogata praised Hanazawa's 
                    work.
