Above the eyes are small, beige ovals in place of eyebrows, rendered to show that they are skin markings as opposed to hair. The lineart is black and purple with a subtle purple glow."

                I am anti-AI art. My art is not for sale. I do not allow reposts 
                of my art without permission.
            </p>

            <p>
                As a creative hailing from New York and a recent graduated of 
                the Florida Institute of Recording Sound and Technology, I am 
                continuing to hone my artistic skills forever and always.
                Although freelance is interesting and fun, I hope to work with a 
                team and have stable morale.
            </p>

            <p>
                I aim to polish my proficiency in humanoid anatomy, as well as 
                practice and become more comfortable with backgrounds, 
                architecture, animal anatomy, eccentric fashion design, and 
                storytelling.
            </p>

            <p>
                I am interested in fantastical, mythical, macabre things; some 
                gore, horror, unsettling visuals, plots that range from 
                ridiculous to psychologically deep, and the like. I love to use 
                pops of color and work in dynamic expressions and poses when I 
                have the energy.
            </p>

            <p>
                My biggest inspirations are Castlevania (by Powerhouse Animation 
                Studios), Jojo's Bizarre Adventure (Araki Hirohiko), Jujutsu
                Kaisen (Akutami Gege), Case Study of Vanitas (Mochizuki Jun), 
                and Dungeons & Dragons - for which I've fulfilled commissions 
                related to before.

                I am most comfortable with traditional art as my medium and have 
                been practicing Procreate for years. Adobe Illustrator and 
                Photoshop are recent programs I've had the privilege of exploring,
                and I will blend what I've learned into my creative process
                (using free alternatives).
            </P>
