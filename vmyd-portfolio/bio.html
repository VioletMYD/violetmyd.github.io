                I am anti-AI art. My art is not for sale. I do not allow reposts 
                of my art without permission.
            </p>

            <p>
                As a creative hailing from New York and currently a student at 
                the Florida Institute of Recording Sound and Technology, I am 
                continuing to hone my artistic skills forever and always.
                Although freelance is interesting and fun, I hope to work with a 
                team and have stable morale.
            </p>

                I aim to polish my proficiency in humanoid anatomy, as well as 
                practice and become more comfortable with backgrounds, 
                architecture, animal anatomy, eccentric fashion design, and 
                storytelling.
            </p>

            <p>
                I am interested in fantastical, mythical, dark things; some 
                gore, horror, unsettling visuals, plots that range from 
                ridiculous to psychologically deep, and the like. I love to use 
                pops of color and work in dynamic expressions and poses when I 
                have the energy.
            </p>

                My biggest inspirations are Castlevania (by Powerhouse Animation 
                Studios), Jojo's Bizarre Adventure (David Production), Case 
                Study of Vanitas (Bones), and Dungeons & Dragons - for which 
                I've fulfilled commissions related to before.

                I am most comfortable with traditional art as my medium and have 
                been practicing Procreate for years. Adobe Illustrator and 
                Photoshop are recent passions that I've dabbled in and want to 
                mix into my creative process.
