            <p id="description">
                <span>SCP-529</span> is a small house cat (Felis catus) with 
                grey tabby markings.
                Parts of the animal to the rear of the end of the ribcage appear 
                to be missing. The body terminates sharply as if sliced in two.
                In spite of this, the animal has no health problems, and moves 
                about as if its hindquarters were still in place. For example, 
                walking takes place as usual, and some time after feeding the 
                animal makes motions as if to void itself of waste matter.
                The cross-section does not display the interior of the animal, 
                but appears pure black to the eye, and absorbs all non-visible 
                wavelengths of light. It is slightly yielding to the touch. 
                Gentle stroking of this area sometimes yields a positive 
                reaction (purring and so on) but more usually leads to the 
                creature turning on the agent, claws at the ready. Those 
                scratched have experienced no abnormalities.
                The hind regions do not appear to be invisible - a cursory 
                examination will show that there are no hindquarters. DNA 
                testing has shown the animal to be female.
