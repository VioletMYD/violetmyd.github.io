                <span>SCP-042</span> is an animal believed to be a member of the 
                genus Equus. Its coat is white in color with some small brown 
                spotting. It stands at 183 cm (18 hands) to its withers and 
                weighs 710 kg. 
                Its weight has dropped significantly since it has 
                been in Foundation custody, due to both atrophy from lack of 
                physical activity and refusal to eat. The liquid nutrient diet 
                forcibly administered keeps it alive but it remains emaciated 
                and weak. SCP-042 exhibits two large bone protrusions from its 
                back, linked to powerful musculature (now atrophied) throughout 
                its back. These bones end at 37 centimeters from the surface of 
                its back, and they protrude from the skin at open, ragged 
                wounds. To date, no healing has been observed of these wounds, 
                though some clotting must be taking place for SCP-042 to have 
                not bled out.
